1) take genotypes from each consecutive cycle and put them into 1 DF with observations in rows and loci in columns
2) genotypes should be numbered
3) loci should be numbered 
4) add a row to the data indicating the alleles at each locus 
5) add a row indicating whether or not ancestral allele is the 0 or 1

6) in python, use tsinfer.SampleData() to create a SampleData object
7) run SampleData into tsinfer.Infer() command
