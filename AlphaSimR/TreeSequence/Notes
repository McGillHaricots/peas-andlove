1) take genotypes from each consecutive cycle and put them into 1 DF with observations in rows and loci in columns
2) genotypes should be numbered
3) loci should be numbered 
4) add a row to the data indicating the alleles at each locus 
5) add a row indicating whether or not ancestral allele is the 0 or 1

6) in python, use tsinfer.SampleData() to create a SampleData object
7) run SampleData into tsinfer.Infer() command 


Wed Sept 6
tsinfer requires position and alleles for each of the sites
loci are added one by one to the sample data
in order to  get positions and alleles, I took the genetic map I used in ASR and lined it up (in R) with the original
  DF of loci locations from our SNP data(genome studio export file)
Then I created a data frame with an ID number for each locus, its location(morgans), and its alleles
I wrote a function that would pass over the DF of genotypes and the DF of locus information and add each locus using sample_data.add_site
