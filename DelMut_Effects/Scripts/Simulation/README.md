- Genetic map from [DÃ­az et al., (2020)](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-07213-6#MOESM7), "Genetic mapping for agronomic traits in a MAGIC population of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) under drought conditions".

- The AlphaSim simualtion is devided into three scripts:
    - Parameter Simulation
    - Creation of baseline elements (population, crossing schemes, etc)
    - Simulation in loops with number of itterations and cycles
